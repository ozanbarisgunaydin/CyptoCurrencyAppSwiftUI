Using API technology for tracking cypto currencies.

Using MVVM architecture, the data transferred to the application with "async - await" tools and 'API/JSON' methods are run asynchronously. In addition, it is provided to run the tasks with parallel programming (threading). In the meantime, it is ensured that the function used in the application can be paused and resumed, especially with the "await" tool. In other words, "async || await" tools are used on "SwiftUI" instead of "escaping" tool.
